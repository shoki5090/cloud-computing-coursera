# Cloud Computing

## Definition
- Elastic to need
- Pay as you go
- Geographic Elasticity

## Physical vs Virtualized vs Serverless

- Virtualized still needs maintanance
- Automated Services are build on top on **container**

## IaaS Paas
- Infrastructure as a Service (managed infra)
- Platforma as a Service  (dynamic infra)

## Geographical Advantage
- Servers and cables everywhere allows Google Cloud to deliver content at doorsteps

## Data Center < Zone < Region < Multi-Region
- All have fast connectivity (under 5ms)
- Can deploy data and services to multi region to prevent loss redundatly

## Anti Locked-In
- Open Source Products
- Microservices allows multiple cloud providers

## Services
- Compute
- Storage
- Big Data 
- Machine Learning

## Resource Hierarchy

- Track resource and quota usage
- Name (Changeable and not need to be unique) and Project ID (Unchangeable and globally unique)
- Can Use Folders to organize projects (Also asssign policies on folder basis)
- Inheritance by parent to children
